# Deployment Guide for StudyVibe

## Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)

**Why Replit is recommended for this project:**
- Your app is a full-stack application with Express.js backend
- You use PostgreSQL database 
- You have real-time features and API endpoints
- Replit handles all of this automatically

**Steps:**
1. Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface
2. Choose "Autoscale" deployment for production use
3. Your app will be deployed with a `.replit.app` domain
4. Database and environment variables are handled automatically

## Option 2: Firebase Hosting (Static Frontend Only)

**Important:** Firebase Hosting can only host your React frontend. Your backend API and database would need to be hosted elsewhere (like Replit, Vercel, or Railway).

**Steps for Firebase Hosting:**

### 1. Initialize Firebase Project
```bash
npx firebase login
npx firebase init hosting
```

### 2. Update Firebase Configuration
Edit `.firebaserc` to use your Firebase project ID:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "your-firebase-project-id"
  }
}
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
npx firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 4. Configure API Backend
You'll need to:
- Deploy your Express.js server elsewhere (Replit, Railway, Vercel, etc.)
- Update your frontend API requests to point to the deployed backend URL
- Set up your PostgreSQL database on a cloud provider

## Recommendation

For your StudyVibe app, **use Replit Deployment**. It's:
- ✅ Easier to set up (one click)
- ✅ Handles full-stack apps automatically
- ✅ Includes database hosting
- ✅ Manages environment variables
- ✅ Provides HTTPS automatically
- ✅ Handles scaling

Firebase Hosting would require you to:
- ❌ Deploy backend separately
- ❌ Set up database hosting separately  
- ❌ Configure CORS and API endpoints
- ❌ Manage multiple deployment pipelines
